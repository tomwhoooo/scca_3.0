# scca_3.0
A desperate attempt by a poor student who has to use this package but bad bad R discontinued all packages built before 3.0.\\
It workd at least...\\
Original package built by Yudi Patwan et el, can be found at http://fafner.meb.ki.se/personal/yudpaw/?page_id=13\\
When loading it please still library(scca) instead of library(scca_3.0).\\
